## Instructions to setup and run project
Make sure mongosh is running as a background service
Make sure to install the following packages using npm install in the server directory:
    express
    express-session
    connect-mongo
    nodemon

    Run npm install axios in the client directory.

To run our project, first make sure to create a fake_so database in the mongo compass. Then run our server/init.js file to populate the database. The first two arguments will the username and password for an admin user. The third argument will be adress to the mongodb. The email to login to this admin account will be 'admin@gmail.com' Then you can run nodemon server.js in our server directory and then npm start in our client directory.
